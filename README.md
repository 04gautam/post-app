#Full Stack Post Application
Welcome to the Full Stack Post Application! This is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to create posts and associate them with authors. It is built using a full-stack approach, combining both frontend and backend technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

Features
Create Posts: Users can create new posts with a title, content, and an associated author.

View Posts: All posts are displayed in a user-friendly interface, showing the post title, content, and author.

Author Management: Each post is linked to an author, making it easy to track who created which post.

Time Functionality (Coming Soon): In a future update, we will add timestamps to posts to show when they were created or last updated.

Technologies Used
Frontend
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the application.

Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

Backend
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side of the application.

Express: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and middleware.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store posts and authors.

Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

Development Tools
Git: For version control.

NPM: For managing dependencies.

Postman: For testing API endpoints.
